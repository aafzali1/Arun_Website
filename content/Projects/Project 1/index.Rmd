# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}

tidyweather <- weather %>%
  select(-"J-D",-"D-N",-"DJF",-"MAM",-"JJA",-"SON") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13,
               names_to = "month",
               values_to = "delta")
```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a separate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap}

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap("month") +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )


```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculates a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval=="2011-present") %>%
     summarise(mean=mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE), SD=sd(delta, na.rm=TRUE),count=n(),                      SE=SD/sqrt(count),lower_ci = mean - 1.96*SE, upper_ci = mean + 1.96*SE)

formula_ci %>%
  kbl(caption = 'Confidence Interval for the Annual Delta since 2011 using first principles')%>%
  kable_styling()

```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta

#calculating confidence interval with bootstrapping
bootstrap_delta <- comparison %>%
  filter(Year>= 2011) %>%
  specify(response=delta) %>%
  generate(reps =1000, type ="bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat ="mean")

infer_ci <- bootstrap_delta %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level=0.95,type="percentile")

infer_ci %>%
  kbl(caption = 'Confidence Interval for the Annual Delta since 2011 using bootstrapping')%>%
  kable_styling()

```

> From analysis of the sample database, we’re 95% confident that the interval (0.915, 1.02) captured the true mean value. In other words, if we make 20 repeat observations and calculate 95% confidence intervals for each observation, we can expect that around 19 of those intervals will contain the true annual delta since 2011.

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

### New variable`snap_insta', measuring the union of snapchat and instagram users

```{r, snap_insta}
gss <- gss %>%
    mutate(snap_insta = case_when(snapchat == "Yes"                 ~ "Yes",
                                instagrm == "Yes"                 ~ "Yes",    
                                snapchat == "No" & instagrm == "No"~ "No",
                                snapchat == "NA" & instagrm == "NA" ~ "NA")
    )
```

### Determining the proportion of Snapchat or Insta users in the sample, of those who gave definitive answers

```{r, proportion_snap_insta}
proportion_snap_insta<- gss %>% 
  count(snap_insta) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=snap_insta , values_from=n) %>% 
  mutate(prop_yes=Yes/(No+Yes))
  
proportion_snap_insta %>% 
  # Playing around with KBL package to produce a more aesthetically-pleasant table
  kbl(col.names = c("Indefinite Responses", "Neither Snapchat nor Insta User", "Snapchat or Insta User", "Proportion of Snapchat or Insta users in sample"),
      caption = '37.5% of the sample population use at least either Snapchat or Instagram') %>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T, full_width = F, font_size = 12)

```

### Constructing 95% confidence intervals for men and women who used either Snapchat or Insta

```{r, snap_insta_by_sex}
#Calculating the proportion of snapchat and insta users, grouped by sex
gender_split <- gss %>%
  filter(snap_insta!="NA") %>%
  group_by(sex) %>% summarize(Total = count(sex), users = count(snap_insta == "Yes"), Proportion = round(users/Total,3))

#Determining the standard error and subsequently the confidence intervals for both sexes
library(kableExtra)
gender_split <- gender_split %>%
  mutate(std_error = round(sqrt(Proportion*(1-Proportion)/Total),3)) %>%
  # 95% confidence interval calculation (z score of 2)
  mutate(lower_level = round(Proportion - 1.96*std_error,3), 
         upper_level = round(Proportion + 1.96*std_error,3))

#Cleaning up the table
gender_split%>%
  rename('Sex' = 'sex',
         'Lower CI'  = 'lower_level','Upper CI' = 'upper_level' ,
         'Standard Error' = 'std_error',  'Number of Users' = 'users', 'Proportion of users' = 'Proportion' )%>%
  kbl(caption = '95% confidence intervals on the proportion of Snapchat or Insta users, grouped by sex')%>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T, full_width = F, font_size = 12 )
```

## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascneding order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 
1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

### Adjusting the variable type of `degree'
```{r, degree_factor}
twitter_gss<- gss %>% 
  na.omit(degree) %>% 
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, 
                         levels = c("Lt high school", 
                                    "High School", 
                                    "Junior college", 
                                    "Bachelor", 
                                    "Graduate"))) %>% 
  arrange((degree))
```

### Creating a new variable `bachelor_graduate' that distinguishes between pre and post bachelor degrees
```{r, bachelor_graduate}
twitter_gss <- twitter_gss %>% 
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = case_when(
    degree == "Bachelor" |  degree == "Graduate" ~ "Yes", 
    degree == "Lt high school" | degree == "High School" | degree == "Junior college" ~ "No"
    ))
```

### Calculating the proportion of `bachelor_graduate`s that use twitter
```{r, twitter_users}
proportion_twitter<- twitter_gss %>% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes") %>%
  count(twitter) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=twitter , values_from=n) %>% 
  mutate(prop_yes=Yes/(No+Yes))

proportion_twitter %>% 
  # Playing around with KBL package to produce a more aesthetically-pleasant table
  kbl(col.names = c("Indefinite Responses", "Do not use Twitter", "Twitter User", "Proportion of Twitter users in sample of Bachelor Grads"),
      caption = '23.3% of bachelor grads from the sample population use twitter') %>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T, full_width = F, font_size = 12, )
```

### Constructing 95% confidence intervals for bachelor grads who use and don't use twitter (excluding NAs)
```{r, twitter_prop}
#Calculating the proportion of snapchat and insta users, grouped by sex
bachelor_prop <- twitter_gss %>%
  filter(bachelor_graduate =="Yes") %>%
  filter(twitter!="NA") %>%
  group_by(twitter) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(Proportion = count/sum(count))

#Determining the standard error and subsequently the confidence intervals for both sexes
library(kableExtra)
bachelor_prop <- bachelor_prop %>%
  mutate(std_error = round(sqrt(Proportion*(1-Proportion)/count),3)) %>%
  # 95% confidence interval calculation (z score of 2)
  mutate(lower_level = round(Proportion - 1.96*std_error,3), 
         upper_level = round(Proportion + 1.96*std_error,3))


#Cleaning up the table
bachelor_prop %>%
    # Playing around with KBL package to produce a more aesthetically-pleasant table
  kbl(col.names = c("Twitter User?", "Total in Sample","Proportion of Bachelor Grads","Standard Error", "Lower CI","Upper CI"),
      caption = '95% confidence intervals on the proportion of bachelor grads, grouped by their twitter use')%>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T, full_width = F, font_size = 12 )
```

These confidence intervals do not overlap.

## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.


### Combining emailhr and emailmin into a new variable `email'

```{r, email_combo, cache=TRUE}

email <- gss %>%
  mutate_at(vars(emailhr,emailmin), funs(as.numeric)) %>% 
  mutate(email=emailmin*(emailhr*60)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(email))

email

```


### Finding the mean and median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly and visualising the distribution of `email'

```{r, email_dist, cache=TRUE}

email_summary <- email %>%
   na.omit(email) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(email), median = median(email)) 

email_summary

ggplot(email, aes(y=email)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_clean() +
  labs(title="Boxplot showing how long US Adults spend emailing per week!",
       y="Email Minutes"
       )

```


Typically, the mean is a better measure when the distribution is roughly normal. However, if the curve is more flat and/or skewed, as is the case here,  the median is the best gauge of the typical amounnt of time Americans spend on email weekly

### Calculating a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly

```{r, email_bootstrap, cache=TRUE}

ci_bootstrap_email <- email %>% 
  specify(response = email) %>% 
  generate(reps = 100, type="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile") %>% 
  mutate(lower_ci = lower_ci/60, upper_ci = upper_ci/60)

ci_bootstrap_email %>%
    # Playing around with KBL package to produce a more aesthetically-pleasant table
  kbl(col.names = c("Lower CI","Upper CI"),
      caption = '95% bootstap confidence intervals for the mean amount of time Americans spend emailing weekly')%>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T, full_width = F, font_size = 12 )

```

### Interpreting this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units

We found the confidence interval for the mean email usage in the sample to be from 6h24m to 7h28m. Given that the sample mean is 6h57m, we this result does not seem odd and fits the narrative of a confidence interval.

### Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

As we know with confidence intervals, if we increasing our confidence, we also increase the corresponding margin of error, which results in a wider interval. Therefore, if we increase the confidence level to 99%, then we expect the range to compensate by becoming wider. 


# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}

# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# Take a look at data
glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters
approval_polllist_cleaned <- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(modeldate = mdy(modeldate), startdate = mdy(startdate), enddate = mdy(enddate), createddate = mdy(createddate), timestamp = parse_date_time(timestamp, orders = "hmsdmy"))

# Take a look at cleaned data 
glimpse(approval_polllist_cleaned)

```

## Create a plot

We calculate the average net approval rate for each week to see how public opinion has evolved over his presidency. 

```{r}

alpha <- 0.05

approval_pollist_summary <- approval_polllist_cleaned %>% 
  #Keep only voters as the subgroup
  filter(subgroup=="Voters") %>% 
  mutate(week = week(enddate), year = year(enddate)) %>% 
  mutate(avg_net_approval = adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove, year = year(enddate)) %>% 
  group_by(week, year) %>% 
  #Calculate average net rate on a weekly basis 
  #Definine confidence intervals
  summarise(year = year, week = week, mean_approval = mean(avg_net_approval), lower = mean(avg_net_approval) - qt(1- alpha/2, (n() - 1))*sd(avg_net_approval)/sqrt(n()), upper = mean(avg_net_approval) + qt(1- alpha/2, (n() - 1))*sd(avg_net_approval)/sqrt(n())) %>% 
  unique(by = c("week", "year")) %>% 
  arrange(year, week)

#Plot the data
trump_plot <- ggplot(approval_pollist_summary, aes(x=week,y=mean_approval, color = as.factor(year))) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~year) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, color = "gold") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower, ymax=upper), linetype=1, alpha=0.1) +
  labs(title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve-disapprove) for Donald Trump", subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls", y = "Average Net Approval (%)", x = "Week of the year") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#FF736C","#7DAE00","#00BBBD","#C47EFF")) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 0.1, decimal.mark = '.'), breaks = c(7.5, 5, 2.5,0.0,-2.5, -5.0, -7.5, -10.0, -12.5, -15.0, -17.5, -20.0)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 13, 26, 39, 52))

trump_plot

```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

We compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). 

```{r}

#print a table of related variables for further comparison
average_per_week_15_34 <- approval_pollist_summary %>% 
  filter(year == 2020, week %in% c(15,34)) %>% 
  mutate(upper_minus_lower = upper - lower) 

average_per_week_15_34 %>% 
  kbl(col.names = c("Week", "Year","Mean Approval","Lower CI","Upper CI", "Difference between CIs"),caption = 'While the mean approval is decreasing, the 95% confidence interval is growing')%>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T, full_width = F, font_size = 12)

```

When looking at the interval from week 15 (6-12 April 2020) to week 34 (17-23 August 2020) we can see that while the average net approval is decreasing, the 95% confidence interval is growing. The observed decline in average net approval is to be expected, as Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has been sloppy and the U.S. becomes one of the most severe outbreaks of the virus, given poorly enforced and coordinated federal measures and weak norm compliance. The increase in the confidence interval could be due to the uncertain times right now, leading people to be more undecided and unsure about their vote.



# Gapminder revisited

We already analyzed the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, we will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, we will look at data on 

- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

To derive our data, we must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")

library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

view(countries)
view(hiv)
view(life_expectancy)
view(worldbank_data)

```

First of all, we have to tidy our data to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one using [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

```{r}
tidy_hiv <- hiv %>%
  pivot_longer(cols= 2:34, names_to = "year", values_to = "hiv_rate") %>% 
  drop_na(hiv_rate)


tidy_life_expectancy <- life_expectancy %>%
  pivot_longer(cols= 2:302, names_to = "year", values_to = "life_expectancy_rate") %>% 
  drop_na(life_expectancy_rate)


tidy_worldbank <- worldbank_data %>% 
  rename(
    year = date,
    GDP_per_capita=NY.GDP.PCAP.KD,
    primary_school_enrollment=SE.PRM.NENR,
    mortality_rate=SH.DYN.MORT,
    fertility_rate=SP.DYN.TFRT.IN
    ) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.character(year))


join_1<- full_join(tidy_hiv, tidy_life_expectancy, by = c('country','year'))
join_2<- full_join(join_1, tidy_worldbank, by = c('country','year'))


join_2
```


```{r}
final_data <- left_join(join_2, countries, by = 'country')

final_data

  final_data_tidy <- final_data %>% 
  drop_na()
  
  final_data_tidy
```

Now that we have cleaned and joined our datasets, we can make some analyses. First of all, we will look at the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy and generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report our results.

```{r}
ggplot(final_data_tidy, aes(x=hiv_rate, y=life_expectancy_rate)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color = "red")+
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~ region, scales="free") +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy",
       caption = "Source: https://www.gapminder.org/data") +
    xlab("People with HIV per 100 of population (ages 15-49)") +
  ylab("Life expectancy")
```

Next we will look at the relationship between fertility rates and GDP per capita and generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report our results. For that purpose, we define a new dataframe by dropping na entries, and calculating mean data.

```{r}
grouped_data<-final_data%>% 
  drop_na(c('GDP_per_capita','fertility_rate'))%>%
  group_by(region,year) %>%
  summarize(mean_GDP=mean(GDP_per_capita),mean_fertility_rate=mean(fertility_rate))

grouped_data
```

```{r}
plot2<- ggplot(grouped_data, aes(x=mean_fertility_rate, y=mean_GDP)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color = "red")+
 facet_wrap(~ region, scales='free') +
   theme_bw()+
 labs(title = "Relationship between fertility rate and GDP",
       caption = "Source: https://www.gapminder.org/data"
       ) +
  xlab("Mean births per woman") +
  ylab("Mean GDP")

plot2

```

Next we will take a look at the regions with the most observations with missing HIV data and generate a bar chart.

```{r}
na_hiv <- final_data %>% 
  
  select("hiv_rate","region") %>% 
  drop_na(region) %>% 
  filter(is.na(hiv_rate)) %>%
  group_by(region) %>% 
  summarise(count =n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

kable(na_hiv,col.names=c("Region","Number of NA entries in HIV data")) %>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T, full_width = F, font_size = 12)
```

```{r}

ggplot(na_hiv, aes(x= count, y=reorder(region, count)))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x="Number of N/A entries", title="Number of missing entries for HIV rate by region", subtitle="Highest missing values for Europe & Central Asia")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.title=element_blank())

```

Now we will take a look at how mortality rate has changed by region.

```{r}
plot_mortality<-final_data %>%
  drop_na(mortality_rate) %>%
  group_by(region,year)%>%
  summarize(mean_mortality_rate=mean(mortality_rate))
plot_mortality
```

```{r}
plot3<- ggplot(plot_mortality, aes(x=year, y=mean_mortality_rate, group=region)) + 
  geom_line(xaxt='n')+
  facet_wrap(~region,scales='free')+ 
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank())+
  labs(title = "Change in mortality rate over time",
       caption = "Source: https://www.gapminder.org/data") +
  xlab("Years") +
  ylab("Mortality rate (per 1000 live births)")

plot3
```
```{r}
mortality_rate_filtered<-final_data %>%
select(c(country,region,year,mortality_rate)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=year,values_from=mortality_rate)%>%
  rename(year1='1979',
         year2='2011') %>%
  mutate(change = ((year2-year1)/year1)*-100)%>%
  select(c(country,change,region))%>%
  drop_na(change)%>%
  arrange(desc(change))

best_5<- mortality_rate_filtered %>% top_n(n=-5,wt=change)
worst_5<-mortality_rate_filtered %>% 
  top_n(n=5,wt=change)
  
best_5
worst_5
```

Finally, we will analyze the  relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate

```{r}
plot4<- ggplot(final_data, aes(x=fertility_rate, y=primary_school_enrollment,colour=region)) +
  geom_point()+
geom_smooth()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Correlation between primary school enrollment and fertility rate",
       caption = "Source: https://www.gapminder.org/data") +
  xlab("Number of births per woman") +
  ylab("Enrollment in primary school (%)")

plot4
```



# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()

```

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.

```
> From this plot, we can confirm that co-morbidities do have an impact on COVID mortality rate for all age categories and sexes. For example, men over 80 years old with past medical conditions have a 67% chance of dying from COVID as opposed to 29% for men without co-morbidities. More generally, we can see that men are more fragile than women facing COVID as men with and without co-morbidities have higher death rates regarding COVID than women.

# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
install.packages('httr')
library(httr)
library(reshape2)
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day), day= lubridate::day(day)) #added day

bikeday = bike %>% filter (day == 1)
# filtering for first day of month for graphing purposes
bikeday = bike%>% filter(day == 1)
#for weekly no added day
wbike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),week = isoweek(day))

#adding dayweek for weekly data
wbike$dayweek = weekdays(wbike$day)
wbike
#filter out before 2014 data
bike <- bike %>% filter(year>2014)

wbike = wbike %>% filter(year>2014)
```



```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)

bike1 = bike %>% filter(year<2020) %>% filter(year>2014)

avgbike = bike1  %>%
  group_by(month)%>% 
  summarise(sum_rental = sum(bikes_hired, na.rm = TRUE),
  avg_bikes_hired = mean(bikes_hired, na.rm = TRUE))

## don't need but found median
medbike = bike1 %>%
  group_by(month)%>% 
  summarise(sum_rental = sum(bikes_hired, na.rm = TRUE),
  med_bikes_hired = median(bikes_hired, na.rm = TRUE))

#combining dfs
bikeday$variable <- rownames(bikeday)
cbike = merge(avgbike, bikeday)

#Mutating
cbike = cbike %>% mutate(z=ifelse(avg_bikes_hired>bikes_hired, avg_bikes_hired, bikes_hired))

#ggplot
require(ggplot2)
l = ggplot(data = cbike, aes(group = 1), color = group) + geom_line(aes(x = month, y =avg_bikes_hired), color = "blue", size = 2) + geom_line(aes(x=month, y = bikes_hired)) + geom_ribbon(aes(x = month, ymin = avg_bikes_hired, ymax = bikes_hired), fill = "magenta") 
## Facet_Grid where blue line = Avg_bikes_hired
r= l + facet_wrap(~year)

```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, out.width="100%"}
#Expected weekely Bike Rentals; Mean Bike Sales during that month in 2015-2019
wbike
wbike1 = wbike %>% filter(year<2020)

wavgbike = wbike  %>%
  group_by(week)%>% 
  summarise(sum_rental = sum(bikes_hired, na.rm = TRUE),
  avg_bikes_hired = mean(bikes_hired, na.rm = TRUE))


#combining dfs
wbike$variable <- rownames(wbike)
wbike3 = merge(wavgbike, wbike)

#subset by start of week
wbike2 = subset(wbike3,dayweek == 'Monday')
#create % change
wbike2$percentchange <- (wbike2$bikes_hired - wbike2$avg_bikes_hired)/ wbike2$avg_bikes_hired
wbike2 = wbike2 %>% mutate(z= ifelse(percentchange>0,percentchange,0))
#label if positive for aesthetic reasons
wbike2 = wbike2 %>% mutate(pos = percentchange >= 0)


#ggplot
h =  ggplot(data = wbike2, aes(x = week, y = percentchange, group = 1, fill = pos), color = group) + geom_line( color = "black") + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0))+geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=percentchange), fill="red", color="red")+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0, ymax=z), fill="palegreen", color="black") 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)

h
#Facet_wrap
w= h + facet_wrap(~year)+ geom_rug()+ theme_minimal()  
 
w
```
```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
